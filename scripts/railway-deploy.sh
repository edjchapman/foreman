# Deploy ghcr.io/edjchapman/foreman:<version> to Railway (web -> worker -> beat).
#
# Railway does not watch GHCR: pushing a new tag deploys nothing, and
# `railway redeploy` re-runs the *previous* deployment with its original image
# reference. So CD is: pin each service's image to the exact semver tag
# (serviceInstanceUpdate), then create a fresh deployment
# (serviceInstanceDeployV2) via the public GraphQL API. Semver pinning keeps
# every Railway deployment reproducible and makes dashboard rollback
# meaningful (an old deployment re-runs the old version).
#
# ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING: web deploys first and must reach SUCCESS before
# worker/beat are touched. Web's pre-deploy command runs `manage.py migrate`
# and its /readyz healthcheck gates the cutover — so new worker code never
# runs ahead of its migrations. A failed web deploy aborts the whole rollout
# (Railway keeps the previous deployment serving). Worker and beat then deploy
# concurrently and are each polled to SUCCESS — a crash-looping worker fails
# the rollout instead of leaving CD green.
#
# ENV CONTRACT (all required):
#   RAILWAY_TOKEN              project token (env-scoped) — sent as
#                              Project-Access-Token. Set RAILWAY_TOKEN_KIND=account
#                              to send an account token as Authorization: Bearer.
#   RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID     the production environment id
#   RAILWAY_WEB_SERVICE_ID     service ids (dashboard URL or `railway status --json`)
#   RAILWAY_WORKER_SERVICE_ID
#   RAILWAY_BEAT_SERVICE_ID
#
# USAGE: railway-deploy.sh <version>        e.g. railway-deploy.sh 0.7.0
#
# NOTE: Railway returns HTTP 200 for GraphQL-level errors, so every response
# is checked for an `errors` key — curl -f alone is not enough.
